```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",

)
```

In this section, we describe and plot the data.

First, let's load the data again (not necessary, but in case you only run this chapter and not the preprocessing chapter).
```{r}
game_time <- read_rds(here("data/ea/game_time.rds"))
leveling <- read_rds(here("data/ea/leveling.rds"))
xp <- read_rds(here("data/ea/xp.rds"))
gestures <- read_rds(here("data/ea/gestures.rds"))
prestige <- read_rds(here("data/ea/prestige.rds"))
friends <- read_rds(here("data/ea/friends.rds"))
pvz_bfn <- read_rds(here("data/ea/pvz_bfn.rds"))
```

Set option for `ggthemr`.
```{r}
ggthemr("fresh", line_weight = .3)
```


The `pvz_bfn` table contains survey responses, along with each survey respondent's summarized engagement metrics (from the preceding 2 weeks).
Note that the (cleaned, not aggregated) raw survey responses and engagement metrics are in their own tables for e.g. session level analyses.

For example, we can plot the correlations among the aggregated engagement metrics:
```{r}
psych::cor.plot(
  pvz_bfn[,c(70:83)], 
  numbers = FALSE, cex.axis = .75, xlas = 2, upper = FALSE, diag = FALSE,
  main = "PvZ: BfN engagement metrics correlation matrix",
)
```

Or from which date the surveys were.
```{r}
pvz_bfn %>% 
  mutate(Respondent = reorder(player_id, date)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(date, Respondent)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())
```

## Missingness

```{r}
data(pvz_bfn)
vis_dat(pvz_bfn[,1:20], sort_type = FALSE)
vis_dat(pvz_bfn[,21:40], sort_type = FALSE)
vis_dat(pvz_bfn[,41:60], sort_type = FALSE)
vis_dat(pvz_bfn[,61:ncol(pvz_bfn)], sort_type = FALSE)
```

## Example correlations

```{r}
psych::cor.plot(
  pvz_bfn %>% select(autonomy_2:relatedness_1, Hours, xp, score), 
  numbers = FALSE, cex.axis = .75, xlas = 2,
  main = "Example correlation matrix",
)
```



## Dates

When did gameplay and surveys take place?
This is also to do some preliminary checking of our preprocessing.

```{r}
hist(pvz_bfn$date, breaks = 31, main = "Survey date")
hist(xp$date_time, breaks = 100, main = "XP events")
```

## Outliers

Two observations are > 10 SD away from mean on XP and Hours, we take those out for now.

```{r outliers}
plot(pvz_bfn$Hours, pvz_bfn$xp)
pvz_bfn <- filter(pvz_bfn, xp < 2000000, Hours < 100)
plot(scale(pvz_bfn$Hours), scale(pvz_bfn$xp))
```

## Correlation matrix

```{r correlation-matrix}
par(pty = "s")
pvz_bfn %>% 
  select(
    affect = spane_balance, 
    autonomy, competence, relatedness, enjoyment, extrinsic,
    Hours, friends, kills = total_kill_count, deaths = total_death_count, 
    `kill ratio` = total_kill_count/total_death_count,
    `Hit %` = shots_fired/shots_hit,
    gestures, levelings, prestige, xp
    ) %>% 
  rename_all(str_to_title) %>% 
  psych::cor.plot(
    scale = FALSE, stars = TRUE, 
    xlas = 2, show.legend = FALSE, 
    cex = .35, cex.axis = .5
    )
```

## Preliminary figures for presentation

## A typical evening

This figure serves as an overview of the telemetry data, how it is structured and what kinds of things it contains.

```{r}

  select(leveling, player_id, date_time) %>% 
    mutate(event = "Level up"),
  select(prestige, player_id, date_time) %>% 
    mutate(event = "Prestige")

# An illustrative time period
tt <- c("2020-08-03 20:00:00", "2020-08-03 23:00:00")

## Example item-level correlations

NSat2: Think back to when you were playing Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville in the past two weeks. Please read each of the following items carefully, thinking about how it relates to your experience of playing Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville in the past two weeks, and then indicate how true the item is for you When playing Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville (PvZ) in the past two weeks…

GT4: Last, we’re interested again in how you felt in the past two weeks. You’ve already told us how you felt in general. This time, think about playing Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville in the past two weeks. Think about how playing the game made you feel in the past two weeks.How much did you experience each of the following feelings in the past two weeks because of playing Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville?

```{r fig-example-correlations}
# I think we may have an outlier, which I'll cut for this figure
pvz_bfn <- filter(pvz_bfn, total_kill_count < 20000)
# Friends should be zero if NA
pvz_bfn$friends <- coalesce(pvz_bfn$friends, 0)

labels <- c(
  "Strongly\ndisagree", 
  rep("", 5),
  "Strongly\nagree"
)
labels2 <- c(
  "Very often\nor always",
  rep("", 5),
  "Very rarely\nor never"
)

p1 <- foo(levelings, enjoyment_1) + 
  labs(x="Level ups", y = "I think PvZ\nwas fun to play")
p2 <- foo(total_kill_count, competence_1) +

## Well-being & motivations correlations

Let's have a look at the correlations between the concepts of well-being and motivations (aggregated).
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# call the function
pair_plot(pvz_bfn%>% 
        select(
          spane_balance:extrinsic,
          spane_pvz_balance
        ))
```

## Competence and well-being correlations

Next, the correlations between indicators of competence and well-being.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pair_plot(
  pvz_bfn %>% 
    select(
      competence,
      levelings,
      xp,
      prestige,
      total_kill_count,
      spane_balance,
      spane_pvz_balance
    )
)
```

## Relatedness and well-being correlations

Next, the correlations between indicators of relatedness and well-being.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pair_plot(
  pvz_bfn %>% 
    select(
      relatedness,
      gestures,
      friends,
      spane_balance,
      spane_pvz_balance
    )
)
```

## More well-being correlations

Then correlations between well-being, autonomy motivation, enjoyment, and extrinsic motivation.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pair_plot(
  pvz_bfn %>% 
    select(
      autonomy,
      extrinsic,
      enjoyment,
      spane_balance,
      spane_pvz_balance
    )
)
```

Next relations between self-estimated play (effects) and well-being.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pair_plot(
  pvz_bfn %>% 
    select(
      Hours,
      active_play,
      within_estimate,
      between_estimate,
      spane_balance,
      spane_pvz_balance
    )
  )
```
